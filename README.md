## Hi there üëã  
EN | [RU](README_ru.md)

Hello! üëã  
My name is Grigory, and I‚Äôm a developer with a strong passion for building scalable, modular, and high-performing solutions.  
I‚Äôm not afraid of challenging tasks ‚Äî on the contrary, I see them as a source of inspiration and opportunities for growth.

  <summary>More details</summary>
My specialization in Java development, where I leverage modern approaches, including modular architectures, REST APIs, and external service integrations.  
At the same time, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to make development processes simpler and more efficient by automating routine tasks.  

üéØ **My strengths:**  
- A deep understanding of modular monolith architecture and the ability to design systems that remain flexible and scalable.  
- Experience with APIs and SDK development, enabling seamless integrations for clients.  
- Solving complex optimization and performance challenges, such as exploring technology speeds and testing tools.  
- A broad perspective on problem-solving: I understand that quality code is important, but so is effective project and team management.  

üöÄ **What I‚Äôm currently working on:**  
- Improving my skills in integration and business process management using Redmine and other tools.  
- Enhancing my expertise in microservices and their interaction with monoliths.
